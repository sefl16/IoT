IoT - User Interface Project

The goal of this system is to have a visual graphical interface for Affärsverkens IoT sensors. A user/company is supposed to be able to see graphs of the sensors in their real estate, status for example, temperature, humidity etc.. An multi cross application that can be used from PC, tablet and phone. An admin page will exist were it’s possible to add and remove sensors based on their IDs.
